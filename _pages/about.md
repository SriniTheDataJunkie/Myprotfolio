A friend of mine writes short stories. One sunny day, I asked if he wanted a website to showcase his works and he agreed. I decided to use GitHub Pages to host his site. That way he wouldn't have to buy a domain and a server.

While doing some research up on GitHub Pages, I accidentally chanced upon this _simple, blog-aware, static site generator_ called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which works really well with GitHub Pages. I figured it would do just fine for my friend and I set about searching for a pretty theme. I wanted a theme with a _book-ish_ vibe. Unfortunately, most of the themes were too modern. Eventually, I caved and begun working on my own theme. With the help of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), the Jekyll Butler, I was able to build **Tale**.

 $h_\theta(x) = \Large\frac{1}{1 + \mathcal{e}^{(-\theta^\top x)}}$ 
 
 {% highlight python %}
# Sample python code
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
{% endhighlight %}
